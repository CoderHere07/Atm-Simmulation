This project will implement core functionalities of an ATM, including account management, cash withdrawal, deposit, balance inquiry, and transaction history. The system will serve as a practical application of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) while providing an interactive interface for users.
Incorporated Data Structures
•	Array: For storing static data like predefined accounts.
•	2D Array: For maintaining transaction records per account.
•	Linked List: For dynamic transaction history.
•	Stack: For enabling undo operations on transactions
